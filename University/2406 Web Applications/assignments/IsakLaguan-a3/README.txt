NOTES
    - all functionality works 100% to my knowledge of the specs
    - removed most of console.log lines to declutter
    - documented as much as possible
    - arranged files in specific folders to clean up space, and adjusted file grabbing source handlings accordingly
    - included headers for pug pages as a partial file
    - repurposed code from my previous assignments, so the vendor page looks similar to the last assignments

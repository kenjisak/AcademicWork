- added a div for vendor info in html for ease of access and not having to re add all other elements in body or style it
- added innerhtml for names of sections to display on load of page for ease
- removed all debugging code like console.log() for cleanliness
- remove item functionality not 100% keep playing with both adding and removing items and sometimes doesnt remove, keep playing to add or remove items and will be able to remove whole order
    - can see in developer tools the console error when this doesnt work
    - all other functionality works 100% to my knowledge of the specs

    "Earlier this year (first introduced in Tutorial 01, expanded on in Tutorial 02 - refer back if you want a refresher), we looked at an immutable form a linear collection: the ```tuple```. However, while powerful, the immutability (or un-changeability) of the collection limits its usage somewhat. To remedy this, Python has the linear collection called the ```list```. A list works similarly to tuples, but allows us to modify the contents as we wish. This modification, of course, includes changing an element and adding new elements. The syntax for declaring a list is actually also quite similar: we replace the parentheses with square brackets:<br><br>\n",

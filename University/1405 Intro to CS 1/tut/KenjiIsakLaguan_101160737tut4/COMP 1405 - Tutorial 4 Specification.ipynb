    "### Part 1: Looping Control Structures\n",
    "The purpose of control structures is to encode some special behavior so as to make code more efficient and also handle more specialized scenarios. The conditional type structure allows us to encode branching paths in code that are dependent on some boolean condition. However, if we want to repeat code or logic, having to manually write them out over and over again causes code to be unweildly and difficult to maintain. For example, something like this is extremely difficult to read and annoying to write:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<div class=code-title><p class=numberCircleCode>&lt;&gt;</p> Code</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"code\">\n",
    "    <pre style=\"background-color: #f9e6ff;\"><code class=\"language-python\" style=\"background-color: #f9e6ff;\">value = 1\n",
    "if value >= 3:\n",
    "    print(\"Success\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    value = value + 1\n",
    "    if value >= 3:\n",
    "        print(\"Success\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        value = value + 1\n",
    "        if value >= 3:\n",
    "            print(\"Success\")\n",
    "        ...</code></pre>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, amongst others, we use the looping-type control structures. There are two primary types of looping control structures we will explore this tutorial: the while loop and the for loop."

    "### Part 2: While Loop\n",
    "The while loop is a boolean-statement-based looping structure, wherein the number of times the structure will loop is dependent on boolean logic. If we look back at the code we showed above, we could thus easily rewrite it to be something like this:\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "What this snippet of code does is it will run the ```value = value + 1``` part of the loop over and over again up until the boolean statement within the while parentheses is satisfied. In this case, our logic would be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) value = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "2) is value < 3? Yes? Let's enter the while loop then\n",
    "\n",

And, most likely, you've forgotten once or twice to do so on some fragment or another. This seems terribly inefficient and like a huge waste of time. Take this code, for example:"

    "### Part 2: Functions\n",
    "A function is a named snippet of code that can take in parameters or values as well as return something back. In other words, we provide some information to this function, it incorporates this information into some generic code, then returns something back (typically either modified or some boolean-type flag indicating success or failure). Let's have a look at the code that was shown above - we can note that there seems to be about five inputs required - these are:\n",
    "* Type of Item (Sandwich, Coffee, Juice, Soda, and Soup)\n",
    "* The options available (probably a list format)\n",
    "* The 'What kind of' line\n",
    "* The 'Excellent Choice' line\n",
    "* The price\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need to make a function that uses these inputs. The first step is to set up the function definition:<br><br>\n",
    "<div class=code-title><p class=numberCircleCode>&lt;&gt;</p> Code</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"code\">\n",
    "    <pre style=\"background-color: #f9e6ff;\"><code class=\"language-python\" style=\"background-color: #f9e6ff;\">def get_item_type_from_user(type_of_item, options_available, price, input_line, excellent_choice_line):</code></pre>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Make note that we've moved the two 'lines' to the end - there's a good reason for this. In Python, we can supply something called a default value to these parameters. What this means is that, when calling this function, one does not need to provide those arguments (the ones with default values), and failure to do so will simply result in those default values being used. To make use of this, we simply adjust our definition to something like this:<br><br>\n",
    "<div class=code-title><p class=numberCircleCode>&lt;&gt;</p> Code</div>\n",
    "<div class=\"code\">\n",
    "    <pre style=\"background-color: #f9e6ff;\"><code class=\"language-python\" style=\"background-color: #f9e6ff;\">def get_item_type_from_user(type_of_item, options_available, price, \n",
    "                              input_line=\"What kind of {} would you like?\", \n",
    "                              excellent_choice_line=\"The {} {} - excellent choice!\"):</code></pre>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables with default values must ALWAYS be at the right-most side of the argument list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going any further on this though, it's important to cover the concept of function scope (and scopes in general). The next section will explain how this works, before going on and completing the transformation of our original, clunky code in the first section into its complete function form."
